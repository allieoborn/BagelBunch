### Sprint Retrospective 2
What went well?
- We finished everything and the backend came together very nicely with the front end.

What didn't go well?
 - Dan seemed a little concerned that we didn't have a menu yet, so we might not have completed as much as we should have for this sprint.

What specific things you can do to improve?
- We're going to set aside a couple days for all of us to work on it together so we can finish a greater volume of code for this sprint.
