What didn't go well?
 
What specific things you can do to improve?

List the measurement criteria
- this sprint we wanted to have the majority of our application finished
- the requirement was to have 70-80% complete, but we decided we'd try to finish everything 
and then we can spend the last milestone just fixing and polishing things off

Assign a percentage to each team member based on your metric specified in this sprint's planning: 
- Allie: 25%
- Andrew: 25%
- Eli: 25%
- Wesley: 25%
