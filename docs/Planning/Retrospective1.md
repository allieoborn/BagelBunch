### Sprint Retrospective 1
What went well?
- Andrew did a great job with the account login front end

What didn't go well?
- scrum master Allie got covid

What specific things you can do to improve? 
- meet more consistently to stay a bit more synchronized in our efforts.

List the measurement criteria:
- we need to be about 70-80% done with our application by the end of the milestone, so we need to make sure about 20% of the project is completed each sprint. 
- this sprint we wanted to have the backend mostly finished and the account creation/login complete on the front end. Each persons percentage is based on the completion of their assignment in the required time frame.

Assign a percentage to each team member based on your metric specified in this sprint's planning
- Allie: 20% (scrum master)
- Andrew: 30% 
- Eli: 20% 
- Wesley: 30%

All team members were present for the retrospective meeting.
