### Requirements Definition
## Bagel Bunch
#### 1. Introduction and Context
Dan has asked us to make a web application for his bagel store.
This app should lead the customer through the ordering process 
and assist the other characters through the process of preparing 
and delivering the bagels to the customers. 
First a customer should order their food on the website 
(the menu items include bagels, shmears, sammiches, and beverages)
then the chef will prepare their food and deliver it to
the cashier who makes sure it gets to the customer.
This app will help the process go smoothly by updating the 
customer about the status of their order and making it
easy for the employees and the manager to keep track of inventory.

#### 2. Users and Their Goals
- Customers: order bagels
- Chefs: prepare bagels and keep track of inventory
- Cashiers: deliver bagels and charge customers for the bagels
- Manager: make sure there's enough inventory

#### 3 & 4. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
- All the actors(customers, chefs, cashiers, and the manager) need to have a login
- All the actors need to be able to access the web page at any time
- Chefs, cashiers, and the manager should also be able to order food, 
whether that be through an additional customer account, or a function of their employee account

Customers need to be able to:
- Create an account (with $100 in it)
- Account information includes: name, username, password, email, phone number, and customer ID
- View the menu and place an order
- View the status of their order
- If they are at the store in person, their order should be marked as ASAP
- If they are not at the store, specify a pickup time (must be within 24 hours)
- Cancel an order if it's before the chef has started making it
- View their account balance
- Add money to their account (Just specify an amount and have it added, no need to worry about actual credit card info)
- Edit their account info/change their password
- View and re-order previous orders
- Have a notification sent to them when their order is ready
(Notification could be sent through email or text message - 
I would think text message would be the most convenient for the customer)
- If they buy a dozen bagels, have their account note that they get a free bagel

Chef needs to be able to:
- View all open bagel orders
- View the time it needs to be ready
- Mark orders as in-progress

Manager needs to be able to:

(would like to have 100 of everything in inventory)
- Mark individual inventory items as restocked 
(Could also include an option for marking the whole store as restocked rather than just individual items)
- Approve Cashier/Chef accounts
- Add/Remove menu items

#### 5. Future Features
- Store information about which items people buy the most and which items get thrown away, 
so they can improve inventory purchasing strategies in the future
- Sort menu items so that the most popular items are at the top
