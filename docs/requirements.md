### Requirements Definition
## Bagel Bunch
#### 1. Introduction and Context
Dan has asked us to make a web application for his bagel store.
This app should lead the customer through the ordering process 
and assist the other characters through the process of preparing 
and delivering the bagels to the customers. 
First a customer should order their food on the website 
(the menu items include bagels, shmears, sammiches, and beverages)
then the chef will prepare their food and deliver it to
the cashier who makes sure it gets to the customer.
This app will help the process go smoothly by updating the 
customer about the status of their order and making it
easy for the employees and the manager to keep track of inventory.

#### 2. Users and Their Goals
- Customers: order bagels and make changes to their account info
- Chefs: prepare bagels and keep track of inventory
- Cashiers: deliver bagels and charge customers for the bagels
- Manager: make sure there's enough inventory
