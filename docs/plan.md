# The Initial Project Plan

## Summary of the project being built
This project is a Web-based ordering system for a Bagel Shop. It includes the creation of new bagels by the cashier or the customer. This is then made available for the Chefs to know what to make. This Application will keep track of the Bagels Status for all to know and observe.
