# BagelBunch

## Naming Scheme
We used the Vue CLI to initialize our project, so it built a file structure for us. Most of our frontend code will live in bagel-bunch/src/views. In here, we will create a directory for each view in the program.

## Version Control
No one should ever commit directly to the master branch. We will each work on a separate branch and merge it into master once it has been reviewed and tested.

## Tool Stack
We will use Vue to create the frontend. We're not sure exactly what we will use for the backend yet, but the current leading suggestion is Firebase's database and cloud function functionalities.

## Build Instructions
Run `npm install` to install all dependencies for building and testing. You can use `npm run serve` inside the bagel-bunch directory to view the site at `http://localhost:8080`

## Unit Testing Instructions
To run the unit tests, use `npm run test:unit`.

## E2E Testing Instructions
To run the e2e tests, use `npm run test:e2e`.
